## 🧭 Overview

**FaceCast** is a full-stack face authentication and voting system designed for secure, transparent, and user-friendly elections.
It combines **facial recognition**, **liveness detection**, and **real-time analytics** to ensure every vote is authentic and traceable (without compromising privacy).

## 🔬 System Architecture

### 🖥️ Frontend Components

1. **MediaPipe Face Mesh System (`mediapipe-face-mesh-system.js`)**

   * 468-point facial landmark detection
   * Blink & head-movement tracking
   * Random liveness instructions
   * Anti-spoofing texture and motion analysis

2. **Face-API.js Integration (`face-api-integration.js`)**

   * Deep neural network-based face embeddings (128D/256D)
   * Expression & liveness validation
   * Confidence-based face recognition

3. **Complete Registration System**

   * Multi-phase verification with automatic profile picture capture
   * Comprehensive liveness scoring and face embedding generation

4. **Complete Login System**

   * Real-time verification and embedding comparison
   * Confidence scoring and fallback verification

### ⚙️ Backend Integration (Flask)

* Secure endpoints for registration and login
* Encrypted embedding storage (SQLite database)
* Comprehensive error handling and logging
* Role-based access for admin and voters

## 🗳️ Features

### 👤 Voter Features

* Face-based **registration & login**
* **Live verification** with random actions (blink, smile, head turn)
* Personalized **dashboard** for elections and results
* Real-time feedback on face detection

### 🧑‍💼 Admin Features

* Manage **elections, candidates, and voters**
* View and export **live results**
* Monitor system logs and face match success rates

### 🌐 Transparency Page

* Displays anonymized voter participation
* Shows results of elections each voter took part in
* Builds confidence with open, auditable results
